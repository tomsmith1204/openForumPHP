		                openForum is an easy to implement, open-source message board solution. 
		                My intention for this software is to offer developers a clean forum that can 
		                be easily integrated into any siteâ€”especially those who are already taking 
		                advantage of the Bootstrap framework.

	                	I am currently a student, but graduation is looming. As such,
	                	my main objectives in the development of this software are: gain experience, learn
	                	new technologies, and add on to my portfolio.
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                	Most of the very active development for this project will take place between semesters.
	                	However, I will be contributing as much as my course load and family commitments permit.
	                	If you are a developer who is interested in joining this project, the github repository
	                	is available in the footer. Thank you for taking the time to look at my work.
	                </p>
